Assignment 6 B: What’s my (data)type? Overloading functions allows you to have the
method respond differently based on the type of information passed in.
For this assignment, you will create a method: string WhatsMyType(int data). This
function should return a string that has the value and declare what datatype it is (in this
case, an int). You will then create four overloaded versions of this function with the
following datatype for the parameter:
• String
• float
• char
• boolean
Prompt the user to enter five values (an int, String, float, char, and boolean) and then
prompt them to choose which one to check. (You may assume the user will only enter
correct values for each datatype)
The program should pass that variable to the WhatsMyType() function and print out the
results. You must implement and use the above methods or you will not earn credit.
Sample Output #1:
[What’s my datatype?]
Enter an int: 12
Enter a string: Bonsoir!
Enter a float: 3.14
Enter a char: t
Enter a boolean: true
What datatype do you want to check?
char
‘t’ is a char value!
Sample Output #2:
[What’s my datatype?]
Enter an int: -3
Enter a string: Ixnay
Enter a float: 6.8
Enter a char: f
Enter a boolean: false
What datatype do you want to
